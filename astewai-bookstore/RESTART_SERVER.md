# 🔄 RESTART YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER

## The Issue
The logs show old code is still running, even though we've updated it. This is a caching issue.

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Stop the Server
In your terminal where `pnpm dev` is running:
- Press **Ctrl+C** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+C** (Mac)
- Wait for it to stop completely

### Step 2: Start the Server Again
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Purchase
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3001/books/8f67e22d-f9e1-4abb-96c0-19abf7da25ab`
2. Click "Buy Now"
3. Check the console logs - should now show:
   ```
   🚀 NEW VERSION - Received purchase request: {...}
   📝 Creating purchase with BASIC data only: {...}
   ```

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Good Logs (New Version):
```
🚀 NEW VERSION - Received purchase request: {...}
📝 Creating purchase with BASIC data only: {
  "user_id": "...",
  "item_type": "book", 
  "item_id": "...",
  "amount": 0.11,
  "status": "pending_initiation",
  "created_at": "..."
}
✅ Purchase created successfully: abc123
```

### ❌ Bad Logs (Old Version):
```
✅ Telegram columns found, adding to purchase data
Creating purchase with data: {
  "item_title": "New Book",  // ← This shouldn't be here!
  ...
}
```

## 🎯 Expected Result

After restarting:
- ✅ New logs appear with "🚀 NEW VERSION"
- ✅ No more `item_title` in the purchase data
- ✅ Purchase creation should work (or give a clearer error about database migration)

**If you still see the old logs after restarting, there might be a deeper caching issue with your development environment.**
