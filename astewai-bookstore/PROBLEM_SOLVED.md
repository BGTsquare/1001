# 🎉 PROBLEM SOLVED!

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

The issue was **duplicate code**! There were TWO places handling purchase creation:

1. ✅ **Purchase Service** (`src/lib/services/purchase-service.ts`) - Updated correctly
2. ❌ **API Route** (`src/app/api/purchases/initiate-telegram/route.ts`) - Still had old code with `item_title`

The API route was doing direct database operations instead of using the service, and it was still trying to include `item_title` which doesn't exist in your database.

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### Fixed the API Route
- ❌ **Before**: Direct database operations with `item_title`
- ✅ **After**: Uses the purchase service (no `item_title`)

### Code Changes
```typescript
// OLD CODE (causing the error):
const purchaseData = {
  user_id: user.id,
  item_type: itemType,
  item_id: itemId,
  item_title: itemTitle,  // ← This was the problem!
  amount: parseFloat(amount),
  // ...
}

// NEW CODE (fixed):
const result = await purchaseService.initiateTelegramPurchase({
  userId: user.id,
  itemType,
  itemId,
  amount: parseFloat(amount)
})
```

## 🧪 Test the Fix

1. **Restart your development server** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   # Stop: Ctrl+C
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Test the purchase**:
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3001/books/8f67e22d-f9e1-4abb-96c0-19abf7da25ab`
   - Click "Buy Now"
   - Should now work without the `item_title` error!

## 🎯 Expected Results

### ✅ Success Case (Basic Purchase):
```
🚀 NEW VERSION - Received purchase request: {...}
📝 Creating purchase with BASIC data only: {
  "user_id": "...",
  "item_type": "book",
  "item_id": "...",
  "amount": 0.11,
  "status": "pending_initiation",
  "created_at": "..."
}
✅ Purchase created successfully: abc123
```

### 🔄 Next Step (Database Migration):
If you want the full Telegram functionality, run the SQL from `URGENT_DATABASE_FIX.md` to add the Telegram columns.

## 🏆 Summary

- ✅ **Fixed**: Removed duplicate code causing `item_title` error
- ✅ **Simplified**: API now uses the purchase service
- ✅ **Working**: Basic purchase creation should work
- 🔄 **Optional**: Run database migration for full Telegram features

**The purchase flow should now work without errors!**
